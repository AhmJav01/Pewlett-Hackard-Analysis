# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to learn how to us SQLs (specifically pgAdmin) in order to read data sets that were provided, and combine them to create new data sets consisiting of only the desired data points needed for analysis. In order to do so, primary and feature keys needed to be established between the six data tables given, in order to help combine data tables by joining two or more tables at a common data point. Image 1 shows a flow chart of how different data tables are connected with one and/ or  keys  which connect similar data points in different tables.

## Results
Four major points from the data anaylsis are:
1. Senior Engineers are the position with the most number of retiring employees (29414 employees) as show in Image 2
2. 499,495 employyes are qualified to be part of the mentorship prorgram (Image 3 shows the first few employees eligible)
3. Managers are the position with the least number of retiring employees (2) as show in Image 2
4. The two senior positions (Senior Engineer & Senior Staff) will have more retirees than the remiaing five positions combined (57,668 retirees vs 32,730 retirees)

### Summary
In Conclusion, two major questiosns can be answered by using the data collected in this analysis
1. There will be a total of 90,936 positions that will need to be filled at the end of the  "silver tsunami" 
2. There will be enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departemnts to mentor the next generation, as the number of mentorship eligible employees vastly outweighs the number of retiring employees
